# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `dart analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Dart code.
include: package:lints/recommended.yaml

# For more information about the core and recommended lints, see
